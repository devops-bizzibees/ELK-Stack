**ELK Stack Setup for Application Logs and Bandwidth Calculation**

Project Overview
This project involves setting up the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to collect, process, and visualize logs from an application via Nginx. A key feature of this setup is its ability to calculate and monitor user bandwidth, providing insights into usage patterns and resource allocation.


Key Components and Configuration:

Complete ELK Stack Setup:

Elasticsearch: Configured as the central data store to index and store log data for fast retrieval and analysis.
Logstash: Configured as the pipeline processor, collecting and parsing logs from Nginx, and sending the structured data to Elasticsearch.
Kibana: Set up as the visualization interface to analyze user traffic patterns, including bandwidth usage.
Log Ingestion from Nginx:

Integrated Nginx as the reverse proxy for the application, configured to log essential user request details, including IP addresses, timestamps, requested URLs, and data transfer size.
Developed Logstash filters to parse Nginx logs and extract fields for bandwidth calculations, such as request size, URL, status codes, and user agents.
Bandwidth Calculation:

Designed Logstash filters to process data transfer metrics from Nginx logs and calculate bandwidth usage per user or IP address.
Created Elasticsearch aggregations to monitor daily, weekly, and monthly bandwidth usage, providing detailed insights into user activity and application load.
Dashboards and Visualizations:

Built custom Kibana dashboards to display metrics, including:
Total bandwidth usage per user or IP address.
Bandwidth trends over time.
Peak usage times to help optimize resource allocation.
Created visualizations for monitoring application performance, user access patterns, and Nginx error rates.
